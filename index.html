    <p id="tellMe">If you had told me two years ago, in 2021 I would be sitting behind a computer building my first website, I would've told you that unicorns are also romaing the forest, and pixies are dining with the fairies on toadstools.</p>
 
  <p>2021 is here, and here I am sitting behind this here computer, writing code for my very first website. <br>
  It's a funny old world we live in. 
  <br>
  If there is one thing I have learnt in the past two (very strange) years, it is that 32 is the wrong age to decide your going to finally buy a skateboard and teach yourself to skate. </p>
  
  <p>Just kidding, life is too short, you never know what is going to happen tomorrow, so if there is something you have always wanted to do, DO IT, its never too late to pick up a new skill, except maybe, if you are 32 and if it is skateboarding your after learning, maybe stick to flat surfaces and stay away from those hills.
